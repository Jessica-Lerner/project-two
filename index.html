      As novel coronavirus cases spiked in areas with large Orthodox Jewish populations over the past few months in New York City, the rise has been found, in part, to have been linked to large gatherings.
      <p>
        From there, followed a flurry of reports that Orthodox Jews were not only not wearing masks and social distancing but also blatantly disregarding executive orders from city officials.
      <p>
        Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the recent <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9" target="_blank">311 complaints</a> filed during October
        reflect the ZIP codes de Blasio labeled as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/nyregion/coronavirus-zip-codes-nyc.html" target="_blank">COVID-19 'hot spots'</a> earlier that month.
      <p>
        Of the Top 10 ZIP codes, nine of them were among the 20 ZIP codes given either 'red' or 'orange' zones designations,
        or areas with significantly higher infection rates for COVID-19.
      <p>
        A majority of these areas, he said, have large Orthodox Jewish populations, and therefore, support claims that areas with Orthodox Jews are not complying with COVID-related regulations.
